My first forray into twitch chat bots. I'll be running it on my [twitch channel](https://www.twitch.tv/gladddy) if you want to mess with it and/or watch very mediocore gameplay. 

The bot is running on heroku and is using MongoDB Atlas for storing some responses.

# Commands
All commands must be preceded by "!"

## !d20

Simulates rolling a 20-sided die.

## !copypasta

Shares a random copypasta. Copypastas are stored in a mongoDB instance hosted on Mongo Atlas.

## !sourcecode

Shares a link to this here repo. 

# Other Triggers

## @Gladbot420

When another chatter @s gladbot, gladbot rudely responds to them with "How dare you speak to me"

## Among Us/Amogus

When another chatter sends a message in chat containing the words "Among Us" or "Amogus" gladbot responds with a rant about people posting about among us.
